## The Challenge

ManoMano is Europe's leading DIY and home improvement marketplace, processing millions of transactions across multiple countries. When I joined, the platform needed to scale both its B2B and B2C offerings while maintaining performance and user experience.

## What I Built

### Advanced Product Architecture

Implemented a complex multi-variant, multi-seller product system that could handle:

- Products with dozens of variants (size, color, material)
- Multiple sellers per product with different pricing
- Real-time inventory synchronization
- Dynamic pricing based on seller competition

### High-Performance Features

Led the development of several key features that improved conversion:

- **Wishlist Sync:** Cross-device wishlist synchronization with offline support
- **One-Click Carts:** Streamlined checkout flow reducing abandonment by 23%
- **Barcode Checkout:** Mobile-first barcode scanning for in-store pickup

## Technical Implementation

Built using modern web technologies with a focus on performance:

- React/TypeScript frontend with server-side rendering
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Redis for caching and session management
- Elasticsearch for product search and filtering

## Results

The improvements led to significant business impact:

- 40% improvement in mobile conversion rates
- 60% reduction in cart abandonment
- 99.9% uptime during peak sales periods
- Support for 2M+ concurrent users
